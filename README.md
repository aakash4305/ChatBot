# MedicalQA Chatbot

A Q&A chatbot prototype designed to answer questions related to medical publications, specifically targeting breast cancer research with a focus on HER-2/neu oncogene amplification.

## üîç Overview

This chatbot prototype was developed to demonstrate an intelligent question-answering system that can effectively process and respond to queries about specific medical research publications. The primary focus is on the publication "[Human breast cancer: correlation of relapse and survival with amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gary-Clark/publication/19364043_Slamon_DJ_Clark_GM_Wong_SG_Levin_WJ_Ullrich_A_McGuire_WLHuman_breast_cancer_correlation_of_relapse_and_survival_with_amplification_of_the_HER-2neu_oncogene_Science_Wash_DC_235_177-182/links/0046352b85f241a532000000/Slamon-DJ-Clark-GM-Wong-SG-Levin-WJ-Ullrich-A-McGuire-WLHuman-breast-cancer-correlation-of-relapse-and-survival-with-amplification-of-the-HER-2-neu-oncogene-Science-Wash-DC-235-177-182.pdf)."

The project focuses on effective document-based question answering using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology and follows a comprehensive prototype development framework with defined evaluation metrics.

## üìä Detailed Evaluation System

The chatbot implements a comprehensive evaluation system based on key business metrics:

### Performance Metrics

- **Response Accuracy**: 
  - LLM-based evaluation comparing responses against ground truth
  - Factual correctness measurement
  - Support for manual verification

- **Response Quality**:
  - Contextual appropriateness of answers
  - Completeness of information provided
  - Relevance to the original query

- **Operational Efficiency**:
  - Response time tracking in milliseconds
  - System resource utilization

### User-Centric Metrics

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture

This chatbot utilizes a RAG architecture to provide accurate answers:

1. **Document Processing**: PDF documents are loaded and split into manageable chunks
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Text chunks are converted to vector embeddings using SentenceTransformer
3. **Semantic Search**: User questions are matched with the most relevant document sections
4. **Contextual Response Generation**: Retrieved context is used by the LLM to generate accurate, contextually-relevant answers

### Testing & Validation

The implementation includes a robust testing framework:

- **Automated Testing**: Script-based testing for core functionality
- **Human Evaluation**: User interface for collecting human judgments
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Tools for measuring and optimizing response times

### Assumptions Management

- **Data Handling**: Safe assumptions about document structure and availability
- **User Interaction**: Interface design catering to diverse user technical backgrounds
- **Scalability**: Considerations for expanding to multiple documents
